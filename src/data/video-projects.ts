    details: "Alma da Selva (Soul of the Jungle 2023) is a journey into the heart of the forest. From its most ancestral origins to its manifestation through the presence of animals, the jungle appears as a single organism—pulsing, transforming, and revealing itself on the façade of one of the cathedrals of Amazônia Mapping.\n\nWith visuals entirely synthesized through neural networks using the text-to-image technique, Alma da Selva introduces the invisible forces of nature that emerge through sound and the masks of animal spirits. These forces appear to make their presence known—as a warning, calling for respect and protection of the forest.\n\nThe creation is a collaboration between artists microdosys and ilumina chebel for the visuals, and Irû Waves for the soundtrack."

The imagery flows between moments of solitude and communion, nature and intimacy, creating a meditative space for reflection on what it means to embody and express femininity in contemporary society."

    details: "Nature of Movement is a meditative exploration of impermanence and the ever-changing forms found in nature. This animation project was created in 2024 with the assistance of artificial intelligence, blending traditional artistic direction with innovative AI-generated imagery.\n\nThe piece flows through a series of natural transformations - from vibrant flowers to erupting volcanoes, birds in flight to luminous jellyfish - creating a visual poem about the cyclical nature of existence. The vivid color palette and fluid transitions between scenes evoke both the fragility and resilience of natural systems.\n\nThis work stands at the intersection of traditional animation and emerging technologies, questioning how we perceive and relate to nature in an increasingly digital world. Through abstracted natural forms and dreamlike sequences, Nature of Movement invites viewers to contemplate their own relationship with the natural world and the constant state of change that defines all living things."

    isFeatured: true,
    details: "Lotus Bloom is a piece of visual poetry, a gentle ode to the feminine soul. Through the timeless symbol of the lotus flower—rising unstained from the mud—the film evokes the purity, strength, and mystery rooted in a woman's heart. It speaks of beauty that is not for display, but for belonging. A dream of harmony that women carry within, in contrast to a world shaped by conflict and conquest. In its stillness and grace, Lotus Bloom becomes a meditation on softness as power, on the sacred force of life that flows quietly, yet transforms everything."
