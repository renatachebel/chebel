    details: "Created visuals for the indigenous pop singer Kae Guajajara's performance during the Premio SIM à Igualdade Racial 2025, an awards ceremony celebrating racial equality in Brazil. The show was transmitted on TV Globo, Brazil's biggest television channel.\n\nUsing AI tools, I created a series of textures inspired by nature and combined them with traditional indigenous patterns from the Guajajara nation. The visual elements honored Kae Guajajara's cultural heritage while creating a contemporary digital art experience that complemented her musical performance.\n\nThe project showcases the intersection of traditional indigenous art forms with modern AI-generated imagery, creating a unique visual language that celebrates both cultural heritage and technological innovation. The work was designed to enhance the live television broadcast and create an immersive visual experience for viewers across Brazil."

    date: "2024",
    location: "Studio Production",
    isFeatured: true,
    details: "Nature of Movement is a meditative exploration of impermanence and the ever-changing forms found in nature. This animation project was created in 2024 with the assistance of artificial intelligence, blending traditional artistic direction with innovative AI-generated imagery.\n\nThe piece flows through a series of natural transformations - from vibrant flowers to erupting volcanoes, birds in flight to luminous jellyfish - creating a visual poem about the cyclical nature of existence. The vivid color palette and fluid transitions between scenes evoke both the fragility and resilience of natural systems.\n\nThis work stands at the intersection of traditional animation and emerging technologies, questioning how we perceive and relate to nature in an increasingly digital world. Through abstracted natural forms and dreamlike sequences, Nature of Movement invites viewers to contemplate their own relationship with the natural world and the constant state of change that defines all living things."

    date: "2025",
    location: "Studio Production",
    isFeatured: true,
    details: "Lotus Bloom is a piece of visual poetry, a gentle ode to the feminine soul. Through the timeless symbol of the lotus flower—rising unstained from the mud—the film evokes the purity, strength, and mystery rooted in a woman's heart. It speaks of beauty that is not for display, but for belonging. A dream of harmony that women carry within, in contrast to a world shaped by conflict and conquest. In its stillness and grace, Lotus Bloom becomes a meditation on softness as power, on the sacred force of life that flows quietly, yet transforms everything."
