    isFeatured: true,
    details: "\"Sintography\" is a word I coined by blending \"synthesis,\" \"photography,\" and the Portuguese word \"sinto\" — I feel. It is both a technique and a philosophy: to create images that emerge not from what is seen, but from what is felt. This project explores how memory, movement, and emotion can be transmuted into a new visual language.\n\nThe process began by training a LoRA model on the works of women from the Abstract Expressionist movement — artists like Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, and Helen Frankenthaler, whose contributions were often overshadowed by their male counterparts. I then applied this aesthetic memory to my own photographic records of women in Danzamedicina, a method of dance therapy by Morena Cardoso that embraces emotional release through body movement, defying the patriarchal colonialist conditioning of women.\n\nThe AI becomes a collaborator, filtering lived experience through the echoes of painterly gestures. The result is a series of images that feel like memories: visceral, intimate, infinite. Bodies melt into brushstrokes. Faces become sensations. It is not a documentation — it is a transmutation. Each photograph can be translated an infinite number of times into new images.\n\nThe work was first exhibited at the Poetry House during the 2024 Bombay Beach Biennale, as large-format prints on fabric, hand-embroidered with intuitive gestures. During the opening, I performed a live tea ceremony and red-thread ritual, weaving presence into image, honoring the lineage of forgotten feminine expression, and inviting viewers to feel rather than interpret, a work I've called \"Lemniscata\"."
